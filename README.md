# Ticket Booking Price Prediction
This repository contains a project that focuses on predicting ticket prices for air travel using machine learning algorithms. The project utilizes ticket booking data, including air service names, departure areas, and arrival places, to calculate the ticket prices accurately. Additionally, the application is deployed on Streamlit, a popular platform for building and sharing data-driven applications.

### Project Overview
The aim of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict ticket prices based on various factors such as air service names, departure areas, and arrival places. By training the model on historical ticket booking data, it can learn patterns and relationships in the data to make accurate price predictions for new ticket bookings.

### Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of ticket booking records, including information about the air service names, departure areas, arrival places, and corresponding ticket prices. The dataset is preprocessed and prepared for training the machine learning model to ensure compatibility and accuracy.

### Machine Learning Algorithm
To predict ticket prices, a suitable machine learning algorithm is employed. Various algorithms can be used, such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting. The specific algorithm chosen for this project depends on the dataset and its characteristics, with the goal of achieving the best possible prediction accuracy.

### Application Deployment
The developed ticket booking price prediction model is deployed on Streamlit. Streamlit provides a user-friendly and interactive interface for users to input the necessary information, such as the air service name, departure area, and arrival place, and obtain the predicted ticket price instantly. This deployment allows users to conveniently access and utilize the prediction model.
